# Morning & Night Athkar | أذكار الصباح والمساء

## Local Development
**Recommended:** Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage npm dependencies and versions.

This app uses node version 16.13.1.

`npm run build` will export a production-optimized build (minifid, compiled and optimized JS).

## Contribution
Contributions are always welcome (and sometimes needed). Anything that you think might enhance the experience of the user is very welcome, but here are some ideas:
* Supporting more languages, English translations.
* Content creation, addition and/or revision.
* UI/UX enhancements; supporting a wider range of screen sizes and resolutions.
* Adding more athkar and duaas (currently there's only morning and night athkars).
* Adding a backend component, allowing users to customize/modify their athkar list.
